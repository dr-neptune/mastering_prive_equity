#+TITLE: Growth Equity

Growth equity funds occupy the space between venture and buyout investing, providing fast growing but established businesses with funds and support for a transformational leap in their development.

* Growth Equity Defined

Growth equity funds invest in fast-growing businesses which have moved beyond the startup stage in exchange for a minority equity stake.

* Growth Equity Targets

Growth equity funds invest predominantly in three types of businesses:
- late stage venture capital backed companies
  - They are already profitable, need capital to scale operations
- mature small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)
- spinoffs from large corporations

* The Growth Equity Investment Process

- Deal Sourcing and Due Diligence
  - Tough to do, GE opps often don't explicitly need investments
- Value Creation
  - Often value creation is bolstered by Professionalization (systems & processes, governance & reporting, succession planning, mentoring) and new initiatives (market entry, new products, cash flow optimization, acquisition and divestment)
- Exit
  - Seek to exit within 3 to 7 years
  - disagreements between multiple shareholders can complicate the exit process
